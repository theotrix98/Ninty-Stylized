# Ninty-Stylized
A pack of themes for ninstar's Ninty Launcher that are intentionally simple but colorful.

# How do I use Ninty themes?
If you're just downloading a theme to use rather than making one yourself, it's fairly simple. Ish. Usually they're distributed in archive files you'll have to extract, mostly .rar and .zip from what I've seen. Once you have the files (an .ini, a .png, and, if the theme includes background music, an .ogg, all named the exact same excluding their file extensions) extracted to the same folder, just launch Ninty, select "Change Wallpaper", and choose the .png file that the other file(/s) share a name with, and you should be golden. If you're like me and want to have multiple themes to choose from, the solution I've devised is to just have a subfolder for each theme. Or you could just slap them all in one place unorganized, whatever floats your boat. Personally I like to keep them in my Ninty profile folder for simplicity's sake.

...I had to figure this all out from reading their wiki, which details how to *make* a theme but. not how to ... install one? For some reason? ??????

# Hang on, where is everything?
Currently, the complete pack is a work in progress; all background graphics have been created, I just need to create proper .ini files for them and sort them appropriately. Should hopefully be finished within 24 hours. Until then, here's a list of functional themes as I make them, updated as I go:
- Red

Any other theme is currently using the base .ini file template pasted from the Ninty-Launcher repo's wiki, and hasn't been polished yet.
