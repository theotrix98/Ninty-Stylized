# Ninty-Stylized
A pack of themes for ninstar's Ninty Launcher that are intentionally simple but colorful.

Currently in progress; all background graphics have been created, I just need to create proper .ini files for them and sort them appropriately. Should hopefully be finished within 24 hours. This is also my first attempt at making Ninty themes, so while they *should* work properly as I will do my best to test these myself before adding the files to the repo, please forgive me if I somehow manage to fuck up something. Feel free to tell me what I did stupidly and I will attempt to fix it!
